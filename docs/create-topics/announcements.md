# Community Manager Announcements

Community Manager Announcements are the simplest form of notifications and are triggered by a team member manually drafting a message to the users in our Community Manager tool. Follow these steps to create a topic: 

#### Step 1

Log in to the [Admin Portal](https://admin.notifi.network) (create an account if you haven't done so already) and head to the _Alert Manager_ page.
Select the _Topics_ tab (default) and click on "+ Topic" in the top right, then select the "Send announcments from Community Manager".

#### Step 2 

Give the topic a name, this name will be shown to the enduser on the card. Click on "Save Topic".

#### Step 3

The topic will be added to the list and can be added to a [card config](../alert-subscribe/react-card/create-card-id.md). The topic will also appear as an option of topics in the [Community Manager](../alert-trigger/admin-portal/) and you can start sending out messages to users that have subscribed.
