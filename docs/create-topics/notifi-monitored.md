# Notifi monitored alerts

Notifi Monitored Alerts allow dapp developers to write custom logic in Javascript to do any of the following to publish to a *topic*
1. Based on on-chain activity occuring in realtime.
2. Allow periodic execution of logic that queries blockchain RPC's that Notifi provides direct access to.
3. Allow periodic execution of logic that queries any web2 API.

Once the logic is written and submitted, Notifi will take care of running and maintenance of any RPC or storage dependencies.
