# Using Community Manager

Once you’ve logged in to the [Notifi Admin Portal](https://admin.dev.notifi.network/), select the **Community Manager** tab on the left hand navigation bar.

Select the Topic (i.e. list of subscribers) you want to message. Note: You may already have a Test Topic enabled by the Notifi team so you can send test messages internally.

Now select any combination of destinations you want to reach your customers at. You can send a single email or batch the notification across Email, SMS, Telegram, and Discord at once. You can also write custom copy for each notification destination. Note: the end user must be subscribed to those destinations to receive the notification.

For email, select the content format:
* Basic Notifi Template lets you write your own message.
* Custom HTML lets you directly enter HTML, and a backup “Unstylized Message” if the recipient’s client doesn’t support it. We recommend both using the Preview tool and trying the message through a Test Topic before sending it to actual users. Your custom HTML will be framed within a fixed Notifi HTML structure that ensures Unsubscribe links are working in accordance with the relevant email compliance regulation.
