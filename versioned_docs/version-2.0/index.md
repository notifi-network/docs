# Introduction

Notifi is a cross-chain messaging layer for the web3 ecosystem that lets users
understand in the moment what is happening in their decentralized applications
(dapps). Users can subscribe to activities and notifications such as
transaction alerts and DAO proposals over text, email, Telegram, Discord, and more.
Developers can use the [Admin Portal](./alert-trigger/admin-portal/index.md) 
and the [Notifi SDK](./alert-trigger/node-client/index.md)
to send messages and provide custom user notification experiences.
In addition, the [Notifi Hub](./for-users/index.md) 
is a web3 inbox that aggregates all crypto
activity in one place.

There are two ways to get started with Notifi:

- If you want to use Notifi as a developer, you can follow the
  [quickstart guides](./getting-started.md) to create a new Notifi Dapp account
  and set up topics that your users can subscribe to.
- If you want to use Notifi as a user, you can explore the
  [Notifi Hub](./for-users/index.md) by directly connecting your
  wallet. You can subscribe to activities you care about across any chain or
  dapp and choose your preferred communication channel(s).
