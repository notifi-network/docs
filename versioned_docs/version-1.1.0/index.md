# Introduction

Notifi is a cross-chain messaging layer for the web3 ecosystem that lets users
understand in the moment what is happening in their decentralized applications
(dapps). Users can subscribe to activities and notifications such as
transaction alerts and DAO proposals over text, email, Telegram, Discord, and more. Developers
can customize usersâ€™ experiences easily via API and the
[Notifi SDK](https://github.com/notifi-network/notifi-sdk-ts). In addition, the
[Notifi Hub](./for-users/index.md) is a web3 inbox that aggregates all crypto
activity in one place. It is also possible to message other users with
wallet-to-wallet direct messages on different chains using
[xMS](https://www.notifi.network/xms).

There are two ways to get started with Notifi:

- If you want to use Notifi as a developer, you can follow the
  [quickstart guide](./quickstart.md) to integrate notifications and messaging
  into your dapp with the Notifi SDK.
- If you want to use Notifi as a user, you can explore the
  [Notifi Hub](./for-users/index.md) by directly connecting your
  wallet. You can subscribe to activities you care about across any chain or
  dapp and choose your preferred communication channel(s). You can also send
  and receive cross-chain messages using [xMS](https://www.notifi.network/xms).
