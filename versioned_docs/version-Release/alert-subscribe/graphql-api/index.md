# GraphQL API

The GraphQL API enables access to very low-level functions of Notifi,
for both Dapp accounts and end-user subscribers. We highly recommend
using the [Notifi SDK](https://github.com/notifi-network/notifi-sdk-ts),
but if it does not cover your use case, the GraphQL API is located at
https://api.notifi.network/gql, and includes both an introspection schema
and a UI that you can use to submit GraphQL queries and mutations.

If you need any assistance with the GraphQL API, you can contact us through our
[JIRA service desk](https://notifi.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals).
