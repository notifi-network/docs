Input the email address of the new user and select which roles are applicable. A single user can have both Developer and Business roles.

* Developer: User can access the React Card and make changes in that instance.
* Business: User can access Community Manager marketing tooling.

Soon, both Developer and Business roles will have access to notification reporting and metrics in the Admin Portal.

The new user will get an email invite to access the Admin portal. They can finish creating their account by resetting their password.

### Sending a Test Message

Log in to the [Notifi Admin Portal](https://admin.dev.notifi.network/) using an admin or developer email address and password.

Click on Send Test Messages in the left hand navigation bar.

In the Admin console, add a new topic with Type Broadcast. The Broadcast Id must start with the dappID then two underscores. Since the dappID used is “sampledapp”, the Broadcast Id must start with “sampledapp__”.

Add a subject, and a body, then click **Send Message**. You should see now see “Message sent successfully!” -->
