# Reporting Overview

The [**Reporting**](https://admin.notifi.network/reporting) page in Admin Portal
provides a view into how your users are interacting with your notifications,
including the number of subscribed users, the total number of messages you have sent
on each platform, and details about messages and Community Manager campaigns.

In the top right corner, you also have access to the **Detailed Report (CSV)** view,
which allows you to download CSV files giving even further detail on messages
you've sent and current subscribers you've had, month by month.
